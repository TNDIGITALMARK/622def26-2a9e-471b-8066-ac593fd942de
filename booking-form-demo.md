# Booking Form Integration Demo

## Overview
Successfully created and integrated a mock booking form with the "Schedule Test Drive" button (Component 'S' with Phoenix ID phoenix-1758675578579-27).

## Features Implemented

### 1. Booking Form Component (`/src/components/booking-form.tsx`)
- **Personal Information**: First name, last name, email, phone
- **Vehicle Selection**: Dropdown with Aurora EX, Genesis IV, Spectre SUV, Other
- **Date/Time Selection**: Calendar picker and time slot dropdown
- **Additional Message**: Optional textarea for special requests
- **Form Validation**: Required field validation and disabled submit until all required fields filled
- **Responsive Design**: Works on both desktop and mobile
- **Luxury Styling**: Matches the existing gold/dark theme

### 2. Integration Points

#### Main Hero Button (Phoenix ID: phoenix-1758675578579-27)
- Located at: `src/app/page.tsx:197`
- Added `onClick={handleScheduleTestDrive}` event handler
- Added `data-phoenix-id="phoenix-1758675578579-27"` attribute for tracking

#### Vehicle-Specific Buttons
- Each vehicle card's "Schedule Test" button auto-selects that vehicle in the form
- Passes vehicle model (Aurora EX, Genesis IV, Spectre SUV) to the booking form

### 3. State Management
```typescript
const [isBookingFormOpen, setIsBookingFormOpen] = useState(false);
const [selectedVehicle, setSelectedVehicle] = useState<string>("");

const handleScheduleTestDrive = (vehicleModel?: string) => {
  setSelectedVehicle(vehicleModel || "");
  setIsBookingFormOpen(true);
};
```

### 4. Form Data Structure
When submitted, the form generates this data structure:
```typescript
{
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  email: string;
  phone: string;
  vehicle: string;
  timeSlot: string;
  message: string;
  date: Date;
  timestamp: string; // ISO format
}
```

## User Experience Flow

1. **User clicks "Schedule Test Drive" button**
   - Form modal opens with backdrop blur effect
   
2. **User fills out personal information**
   - First name, last name (required)
   - Email, phone number (required, with validation)
   
3. **User selects vehicle preference**
   - Dropdown with available models
   - Pre-selected if clicked from specific vehicle card
   
4. **User chooses date and time**
   - Calendar prevents past dates
   - Time slots from 9 AM to 5 PM
   
5. **User adds optional message**
   - Textarea for special requests or questions
   
6. **User submits form**
   - Validation ensures all required fields completed
   - Success message displayed
   - Form resets and closes
   - Console logs submission data (in production, would send to API)
